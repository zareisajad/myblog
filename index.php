<h1>Sajad Zarei</h1>

<p>
Hi, I'm Sajad, a web developer from Iran. <br>
four years ago, I was frying hamburgers at a fast food restaurant.
And I'm now a full-stack developer and also a vegan. But don't worry, there's no need to panic!
</p>
<p>
    I'm currently a co-founder at <a href="https://ponezweb.com" rel="nofollow">Ponezweb</a>. <br>
    and working on some exciting projects which I'll write about on <a href="blog.php">my blog</a>.
    I publish some <a href="daily.php">daily updates</a> here if you intrested.
</p>
<p>
    Altough I mostly write in Persian here but feel free to contact with me via <a href="mailto:zareisajad@protonmail.com">Email</a>.
</p>

<small>- Have a Great Day.</small>
